## ❓ What is Headless UI?

A **headless UI** library provides **logic without rendering**. It gives you:

* ⛓️ State management
* 🧠 Business logic
* 🧰 Hooks and functions

…but leaves the **markup and styling up to you**.

> Think of it like a powerful backend brain for your calendar UI — you plug in the visuals.

## 💡 Why Headless?

Headless UI is ideal when you want:

* 💅 Full control over your design system (Tailwind, Chakra, custom CSS)
* ♻️ Reusability across different themes or apps
* 💼 Integration with other frameworks or design tokens

`kenat-ui` lets you build:

* Custom **date pickers**
* Fully localizable **calendar grids**
