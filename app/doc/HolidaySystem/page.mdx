# The Ethiopian Holiday System in Kenat

The `kenat` library has a comprehensive system for calculating and categorizing the many holidays observed in Ethiopia. This system understands the nuances between fixed holidays, movable Christian feasts, and movable Islamic holidays, and provides a powerful tagging system for filtering them.

---

## Holiday Types

Kenat processes three distinct types of holidays to ensure accurate date reporting.

### 1. Fixed Holidays

These are holidays that occur on the same date in the Ethiopian calendar every year.

* **Examples**:
    * *Enkutatash* (New Year): Meskerem 1 
    * *Meskel* (Finding of the True Cross): Meskerem 17 
    * *Gena* (Ethiopian Christmas): Tahsas 29 
    * *Adwa Victory Day*: Yekatit 23 
* **Implementation**: These dates are stored in a `fixedHolidays` map within the library for direct lookup. 

### 2. Movable Christian Holidays

These are holidays whose dates change each year. Their calculation is based on the date of Easter (`Tinsaye`), which is determined by the ancient *Bahire Hasab* computational system. 

* **Examples**:
    * *Nineveh* (Fast of Nineveh)
    * *Abiy Tsome* (Great Lent)
    * *Fasika* (Easter)
* **Implementation**: The library first calculates the date of the Fast of Nineveh for the given year, and all other movable feasts are determined by adding a fixed number of days from that date. 

### 3. Movable Islamic Holidays

These holidays are based on the Islamic Hijri calendar, which is a lunar calendar. Because the lunar year is shorter than the solar Ethiopian year, the dates of these holidays shift annually and can sometimes occur twice within a single Ethiopian year.

* **Examples**:
    * *Eid al-Fitr* (End of Ramadan)
    * *Eid al-Adha* (Feast of the Sacrifice)
    * *Moulid* (The Prophet's Birthday)
* **Implementation**: The library calculates all possible Gregorian occurrences of a Hijri date within the span of an Ethiopian year and converts them to their Ethiopian calendar equivalents.

## Filtering with `HolidayTags`

To make it easy to find specific types of holidays, every holiday in `kenat` is categorized with one or more tags. These are available in the exported `HolidayTags` object.

The available tags are:
* `PUBLIC`: A public national holiday. 
* `RELIGIOUS`: A holiday of religious significance. 
* `CHRISTIAN`: A Christian holiday. 
* `MUSLIM`: A Muslim holiday. 
* `STATE`: A state holiday commemorating a civic event. 
* `CULTURAL`: A holiday of cultural significance. 
* `OTHER`: Any other type of observance. 

### Example: Using the `filter` Option

You can pass a tag (string) or an array of tags to the `filter` option in functions like `getHolidaysForYear` and `getHolidaysInMonth`. 

When you provide an array of tags, the filter returns holidays that match **at least one** of the tags provided (an "OR" search).

    });

    console.log(`Found ${publicHolidays.length} public holidays in ${year} E.C.`);
    // Expected: Lists all holidays tagged as 'public'.


    // Example 2: Get holidays that are 'MUSLIM' OR 'STATE'.
    // Pass an array of tags to the filter option.
    const muslimOrStateHolidays = getHolidaysForYear(year, {
        filter: [HolidayTags.MUSLIM, HolidayTags.STATE]
    });

    console.log(`Found ${muslimOrStateHolidays.length} holidays that are either Muslim or State holidays.`);
