# The Ethiopian Holiday System in Kenat

The `kenat` library has a comprehensive system for calculating and categorizing the many holidays observed in Ethiopia. This system understands the nuances between fixed holidays, movable Christian feasts, and movable Islamic holidays, and provides a powerful tagging system for filtering them.

Kenat provides three main functions for working with holidays:

- `getHolidaysForYear(year, options)`: Get all holidays for a given Ethiopian year.
- `getHolidaysInMonth(year, month, options)`: Get holidays for a specific Ethiopian month.
- `getHoliday(key, year, options)`: Get details for a single holiday by key and year.

All functions accept an optional `lang` parameter (default: "amharic") to control the language of holiday names and descriptions.

Returned holidays are sorted by day. Islamic holidays may occur twice in one Ethiopian year.

If you provide an invalid key or date, the functions return `null` or throw an error describing the issue.


## Holiday Types

Kenat processes three distinct types of holidays to ensure accurate date reporting.

All holidays are returned as objects with fields like:
- `key`: The holiday key (e.g., "enkutatash")
- `ethiopian`: Ethiopian date `{ year, month, day }`
- `gregorian`: Gregorian date `{ year, month, day }`
- `name`: Holiday name (localized)
- `description`: Holiday description (localized)
- `tags`: Array of tags

### 1. Fixed Holidays

These are holidays that occur on the same date in the Ethiopian calendar every year.

* **Examples**:
    * *Enkutatash* (New Year): Meskerem 1 
    * *Meskel* (Finding of the True Cross): Meskerem 17 
    * *Gena* (Ethiopian Christmas): Tahsas 29 
    * *Adwa Victory Day*: Yekatit 23 
* **Implementation**: These dates are stored in a `fixedHolidays` map within the library for direct lookup. 

### 2. Movable Christian Holidays

These are holidays whose dates change each year. Their calculation is based on the date of Easter (`Tinsaye`), which is determined by the ancient *Bahire Hasab* computational system. 

* **Examples**:
    * *Nineveh* (Fast of Nineveh)
    * *Abiy Tsome* (Great Lent)
    * *Fasika* (Easter)
* **Implementation**: The library first calculates the date of the Fast of Nineveh for the given year, and all other movable feasts are determined by adding a fixed number of days from that date. 

### 3. Movable Islamic Holidays

These holidays are based on the Islamic Hijri calendar, which is a lunar calendar. Because the lunar year is shorter than the solar Ethiopian year, the dates of these holidays shift annually and can sometimes occur twice within a single Ethiopian year.

Kenat will return all occurrences of an Islamic holiday in a year, so you may see duplicates in the results.

* **Examples**:
    * *Eid al-Fitr* (End of Ramadan)
    * *Eid al-Adha* (Feast of the Sacrifice)
    * *Moulid* (The Prophet's Birthday)
* **Implementation**: The library calculates all possible Gregorian occurrences of a Hijri date within the span of an Ethiopian year and converts them to their Ethiopian calendar equivalents.

## Filtering with `HolidayTags`

To make it easy to find specific types of holidays, every holiday in `kenat` is categorized with one or more tags. These are available in the exported `HolidayTags` object.

You can use the following tags for filtering:

- `PUBLIC`: Public national holiday
- `RELIGIOUS`: Religious significance
- `CHRISTIAN`: Christian holiday
- `MUSLIM`: Muslim holiday
- `STATE`: Civic event
- `CULTURAL`: Cultural significance
- `OTHER`: Other observances

The available tags are:
* `PUBLIC`: A public national holiday. 
* `RELIGIOUS`: A holiday of religious significance. 
* `CHRISTIAN`: A Christian holiday. 
* `MUSLIM`: A Muslim holiday. 
* `STATE`: A state holiday commemorating a civic event. 
* `CULTURAL`: A holiday of cultural significance. 
* `OTHER`: Any other type of observance. 

### Example: Using the `filter` Option

You can pass a tag (string) or an array of tags to the `filter` option in functions like `getHolidaysForYear` and `getHolidaysInMonth`. 

When you provide an array of tags, the filter returns holidays that match **at least one** of the tags provided (an "OR" search). 

You can also use the `lang` option to get results in English:

```js
const publicHolidaysEn = getHolidaysForYear(year, {
  filter: HolidayTags.PUBLIC,
  lang: 'english'
});
```

    const monthHolidays = getHolidaysInMonth(year, 1, { filter: HolidayTags.PUBLIC });
