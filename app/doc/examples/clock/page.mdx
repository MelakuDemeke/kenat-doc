## 🧠 How It Works

This clock displays both **analog and digital** Ethiopian time using the `kenat` library.

### 🔁 Features

- Real-time ticking with animation
- Accurate **Ethiopian time** conversion via `Time.fromGregorian(...)`
- Toggle to display time using **Ge’ez numerals**
- Styled analog face with hour, minute, and second hands

### ⚙️ Powered by

- `kenat` — Ethiopian time system
- `toGeez` — numeral conversion
- React hooks + `canvas` for animation
- Tailwind for layout and theme

> Tip: The analog clock runs at `requestAnimationFrame` speed and is sync’d with Ethiopian time logic every second.
